To install the FLDLib library, you can follow the automatically
generated INSTALL file.

A typical way to install it in a local directory consists in
typing the following commands

  ./configure --prefix=TheInstallationDirectory
  make
  make install

To check the library

  cd tests
  make

Example of abstract instrumentation:
  add
    export FLOATDIAGNOSISHOME=TheInstallationDirectory
  in your .bashrc or .profile.

  executable creation
    $FLOATDIAGNOSISHOME/bin/comp_float_diagnosis.sh -affine -optim \
      -atomic filter.c -o file.exe
  separate compilation
    $FLOATDIAGNOSISHOME/bin/comp_float_diagnosis.sh -affine -optim \
      -atomic filter.c -c -o file.o

Some advanced tests requires perl and the package File::ReadBackwards.

To generate an accuracy summary table, you need
- to install python to scan the results in the current directory
- to install ocaml with yojson and biniou to create a summary table

Note: both of these commands will be invoked when building 'table.txt'

  make table.txt

then edit table.txt that contains a summary of the results.

FLDLib has been successfully tested with:
- g++ version 5.4.0 for sequential codes
